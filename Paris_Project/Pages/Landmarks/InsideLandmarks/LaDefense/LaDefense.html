  <p>In 1982 under the tutelage of French President Mitterrand, a contest was started challenging all architectural designers who wished to participate to design a Grand Arche de la Defense. The purpose was to recognize the progress of humanity and humane treatment by international politics. President Mitterrand wanted to erect a monument that contrasted with the famous monument to war, the Arce de Triomphe. A Danish architect and engineer, together created the winning design. It has been described as a hypercube that was set in place by an otherworldly force. Until 2010, visitors could go to the top and have a 360-degree view of Paris. Whether seen during the day or evening, the glass-covered frame and Carrara marble structure glistens in the light. In 1989, the Grand Arche de la Defense was opened to coincide with the French Revolutionâ€™s Bicentennial celebrations. It is an office building for government offices on one side and a private museum on the other. There are additional spaces within the building that is now being considered for use as office space for private firms. In 2010, there were some problems with the elevator to the roof and it was shut down. In addition, the museum and the restaurant that were accessed by the elevator were also closed. Sadly, it has not been fixed at the time of the writing. If you can get to the district in time for sunset, watching the sunset in the center of the arch is breathtakingly beautiful as the glass and marble reflect and magnify the colors.</p>
