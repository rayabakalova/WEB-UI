<p>If it feels like you're on top of the world, it's because you are: La Mer a Boire overlooks the Parc de Belleville, one of the highest points in Paris, which offers a gorgeous vista of the cityscape all the way out to the Eiffel Tower. At the first sign of balmy weather, the large paved terrace is in high demand with the young local crowd, but inside is just as nice: the bright orange cafe offers free Wi-Fi, and serves as a gallery for cartoonists and graphic novelists, as well as a concert hall for young musicians on weekend nights.
