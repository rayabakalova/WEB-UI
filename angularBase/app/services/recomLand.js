Ten years after the film's release, tourists still pop in on their pilgrimage tour of Amelie's Montmartre, but it has largely gone back to being a comfy neighbourhood cafe â€“ minus the tobacco counter, which has been nixed in favour of more sitting room. The scatter of tables and bright red chairs on the sloping pavement is the perfect vantage point from which to observe the lively street market.",

At the first sign of balmy weather, the large paved terrace is in high demand with the young local crowd, but inside is just as nice: the bright orange cafe offers free Wi-Fi, and serves as a gallery for cartoonists and graphic novelists, as well as a concert hall for young musicians on weekend nights.",

With its different restaurants, the Tower has got it covered if you're looking for something to eat, from the simple snack to the finest French cuisine. What is better than eat something delicious and watch the city from the Eiffel Tower?",
